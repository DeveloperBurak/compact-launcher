This is my hobby project that you can launch your program in this launcher.

### LAUNCH YOUR PROGRAMS FROM THERE

install the dependencies:
````shell script
npm install
````

after installed, run:
````shell script
npm run release
````

Now you can see the installer in dist folder, once you installed the app, you are ready to go.
